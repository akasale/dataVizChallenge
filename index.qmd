## The Problem: Mastering Object-Oriented Matplotlib Through the Four Stages

**Core Question:** How can we create compelling, professional data visualizations using object-oriented matplotlib and the four stages of visualization?

**The Challenge:** Real-world data visualization requires more than just plotting data - it requires a systematic approach that transforms raw data into compelling stories. The four stages framework provides a proven methodology for creating visualizations that inform, persuade, and inspire action.

**Our Approach:** We'll work with baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark in Major League Baseball. This investigation will take us through all four stages of visualization, demonstrating object-oriented matplotlib techniques along the way.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Four Stages of Data Visualization

The four essential stages for creating effective visualizations are:

1. **Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose** - Define your message and audience
2. **Stage 2: Curation of Content** - Gather and create all necessary data
3. **Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings** - Choose geometry and aesthetics
4. **Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience** - Polish for professional presentation

## Data and Business Context

We analyze Major League Baseball stadium data to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly ballpark. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Real Business Question:** Sports analysts and fans want to understand stadium effects on scoring
- **Clear Hypothesis:** High altitude should make Coors Field more run-friendly
- **Multiple Metrics:** We can analyze both total runs and home runs
- **Visualization Practice:** Perfect for demonstrating all four stages of visualization

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Let's start by loading the baseball data and understanding what we're working with.

```{python}
#| label: load-data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns

# Load 2010 baseball season data
df2010 = pd.read_csv("baseball10.csv")

# Load 2021 baseball season data for comparison
df2021 = pd.read_csv("baseball21.csv")

print("2010 data shape:", df2010.shape)
print("2021 data shape:", df2021.shape)
print("\n2010 data columns:", df2010.columns.tolist())
print("\nFirst few rows of 2010 data:")
print(df2010.head())
```

::: {.callout-note}
## üí° Understanding the Data

**Baseball Game Data:** Contains information about each game, including:
- `home`: Home team (3-letter code)
- `visiting`: Visiting team (3-letter code)
- `homeScore`: Runs scored by home team
- `visScore`: Runs scored by visiting team
- `homeHR`: Home runs by home team
- `visHR`: Home runs by visiting team
- `date`: Game date

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**
1. Is Coors Field (COL) the most run-friendly ballpark in 2010?
2. How does this change in 2021?
3. What's the difference between total runs and home runs by stadium?
:::

## Stage 1: Declaration of Purpose

**Mental Model:** Start with a clear message and bold title that states your recommendation.

Our purpose is to investigate whether Coors Field in Denver, Colorado is truly the most run-friendly baseball stadium in Major League Baseball.

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 1 - Declaration of Purpose

**Question 1: Hypothesis Formation**
- Why might high altitude affect baseball performance?  Is Coors Field affected by high altitude?

**Answer:** 
At high altitudes, the thinner air causes baseballs to travel farther than they would at lower elevations. To offset this effect, Coors Field was designed with outfield fences set unusually far from home plate, making it the largest outfield in Major League Baseball. Despite the extended fences, for many years the park still yielded the most home runs in the league‚Äîand because of its vast outfield, it also produced the highest number of doubles and triples.
:::

## Stage 2: Curation of Content

**Mental Model:** Gather and create all the data you need to support your message.

Let's aggregate the data to get average runs per stadium:

```{python}
#| label: stage-2-content
#| echo: true

# Stage 2: Curation of Content
# Aggregate data to get average runs per stadium

# Process 2010 data
avgDF_2010 = (df2010
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

# Process 2021 data
avgDF_2021 = (df2021
    .assign(totalRuns = lambda df: df.homeScore + df.visScore)
    .assign(totalHR = lambda df: df.homeHR + df.visHR)
    .drop(columns = ['date', 'visiting'])
    .groupby(['home'], as_index=False)
    .mean()
)

print("2010 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2010.head())
print("\n2021 Stadium Averages (Top 5):")
print(avgDF_2021.head())
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 2 - Curation of Content

**Question 1: Data Aggregation Strategy**
- How many games are in the dataset? Why do we aggregate individual games into stadium averages before we start the visualization process?

**Answer**
```{python}
totalGames = len(df2010) + len(df2021)
print(f"\n{len(df2010)} games in 2010 and {len(df2021)} games in 2021 adding to {totalGames} games in the dataset")

homeRun2010 = df2010.groupby('home').size().sort_values(ascending=False)
print(homeRun2010.head(3))

homeRun2021 = df2021.groupby('home').size().sort_values(ascending=False)
print(homeRun2021.head(3))
```
:::
By summarizing results into stadium averages, we can clearly observe the average number of runs and home runs scored at each stadium in a given year. This approach highlights differences in performance across venues and helps identify which stadiums are most conducive to high scoring.

**Benefits of aggregation:**

- Reduces random noise
- Reveals underlying patterns
- Produces cleaner data and clearer visualizations

## Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Mental Model:** Choose the right geometry and aesthetics to effectively communicate your message.

Let's explore different visual approaches:

```{python}
#| label: stage-3-mapping-exploration
#| echo: true

# Stage 3: Structuring of Visual Mappings
# Explore different geometries and aesthetics

# Sort data for better visualization
avgDF_2010_sorted = avgDF_2010.sort_values('totalRuns', ascending=True)

# Create figure with subplots to compare approaches
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(8, 6))

# Approach 1: Scatter plot (not ideal for categorical data)
axes[0,0].scatter(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,0].set_title("Approach 1: Scatter Plot")
axes[0,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[0,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")

# Approach 2: Horizontal bar chart (better for categorical data)
axes[0,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[0,1].set_title("Approach 2: Horizontal Bar Chart")
axes[0,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[0,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

# Approach 3: Vertical bar chart
axes[1,0].bar(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns)
axes[1,0].set_title("Approach 3: Vertical Bar Chart")
axes[1,0].set_xlabel("Stadium")
axes[1,0].set_ylabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

# Approach 4: Highlight Colorado
colorado_colors = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                   for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]
axes[1,1].barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors)
axes[1,1].set_title("Approach 4: Highlight Colorado")
axes[1,1].set_xlabel("Average Runs")
axes[1,1].set_ylabel("Stadium")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 3 - Structuring of Visual Mappings

**Question 1: Geometry Choices**
- Why is a horizontal bar chart better than a scatter plot for this data?
- When would you choose a vertical bar chart over horizontal?

**Answer**
- A horizontal bar chart clearly shows how stadium averages differ, while a scatter plot would obscure categorical comparisons.
- A vertical bar chart will be useful for chronological or short-label data (like seasons or months)

**Question 2: Aesthetic Mappings**
- What does the color highlighting accomplish in Approach 4?
- How does position (x/y) compare to color for encoding data?

**Answer**

- Color highlighting adds emphasis and supports interpretability ‚Äî it communicates importance or exception within the broader dataset. The Colorado (COL) stadium ‚Äî within a larger comparison of average runs per stadium.
- Position (x/y) is best for representing data magnitude ‚Äî exact comparisons. Color is best for categorical distinction or highlighting ‚Äî drawing attention to a subset or pattern.

## Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience

**Mental Model:** Polish your visualization for professional presentation.

Let's create a publication-ready visualization:

```{python}
#| label: stage-4-formatting
#| echo: true

# Stage 4: Formatting for Your Audience
# Create a professional, publication-ready visualization

# Set style for professional appearance
plt.style.use("seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid")

# Create the main visualization
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

# Create color array for highlighting Colorado
colorado_colors = ["darkorchid" if stadium == "COL" else "lightgrey" 
                   for stadium in avgDF_2010_sorted.home]

# Create horizontal bar chart
bars = ax.barh(avgDF_2010_sorted.home, avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns, color=colorado_colors)

# Add title and labels
ax.set_title("Colorado (COL) is the Most Run-Friendly Ballpark in 2010", 
             fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', pad=20)
ax.set_xlabel("Average Runs Per Game", fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel("Stadium (Home Team)", fontsize=12)

# Add legend
colorado_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="darkorchid", label="Colorado Rockies")
other_bar = plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color="lightgrey", label="Other Stadiums")
ax.legend(handles=[colorado_bar, other_bar], loc='lower right', frameon=True)

# Add annotation for Colorado
colorado_index = avgDF_2010_sorted[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == "COL"].index[0]
colorado_runs = avgDF_2010_sorted[avgDF_2010_sorted.home == "COL"]["totalRuns"].iloc[0]
ax.annotate(f"COL: {colorado_runs:.2f} runs/game", 
            xy=(colorado_runs, colorado_index), 
            xytext=(colorado_runs + 0.5, colorado_index),
            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='darkorchid', lw=2),
            fontsize=10, fontweight='bold', color='darkorchid')

# Set x-axis to start from 0 for better comparison
ax.set_xlim(0, max(avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns) * 1.1)

# Add grid for easier reading
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print summary statistics
print(f"\nSummary Statistics for 2010:")
print(f"Colorado (COL) average runs per game: {colorado_runs:.2f}")
print(f"League average runs per game: {avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Colorado is {((colorado_runs / avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean()) - 1) * 100:.1f}% above league average")
```

::: {.callout-important}
## ü§î Discussion Questions: Stage 4 - Formatting for Your Audience

**Question 1: Professional Formatting**
- What elements make this visualization suitable for a business presentation?
- Is the annotation on the visualization helpful?  Can you fix its placement?

**Answer**
- The visualization follows storytelling design principles ‚Äî it‚Äôs simple, focused on one main insight, and visually polished enough for decision-makers to interpret quickly.
- The annotation is helpful because it draws attention to the data point that supports the  headline.

However, the current placement at (colorado_runs + 0.5, colorado_index) can sometimes overlap with the rightmost edge or extend too far, depending on scaling.

```{python}
# Improved annotation placement: offset vertically instead of horizontally
ax.annotate(f"COL: {colorado_runs:.2f} runs/game",
            xy=(colorado_runs, colorado_index),
            xytext=(max(avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns) * 0.75, colorado_index + 0.8),
            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='darkorchid', lw=2),
            fontsize=10, fontweight='bold', color='darkorchid',
            bbox=dict(boxstyle="round,pad=0.3", fc="white", ec="darkorchid", alpha=0.6))

league_avg = avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns.mean()
ax.axvline(league_avg, color='grey', linestyle='--', lw=1)
ax.text(league_avg + 0.1, 0.5, f"League Avg: {league_avg:.2f}", 
        color='grey', fontsize=9, rotation=90, va='bottom')

# Set axis limits for better framing
ax.set_xlim(0, max(avgDF_2010_sorted.totalRuns) * 1.1)

# Light grid for readability
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print summary stats
print(f"\nSummary Statistics for 2010:")
print(f"Colorado (COL) average runs per game: {colorado_runs:.2f}")
print(f"League average runs per game: {league_avg:.2f}")
print(f"Colorado is {((colorado_runs / league_avg) - 1) * 100:.1f}% above league average")
```
:::
The fixed annotation 

- Moves the annotation upward and leftward, keeping it inside the chart area.
- Uses a white semi-transparent background box (bbox) to ensure text remains legible.
- Keeps the arrow clean and visible while avoiding crowding.

## Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques

**Mental Model:** Use object-oriented matplotlib to create complex, reusable visualizations.

Let's create a comprehensive comparison between 2010 and 2021:

```{python}
#| label: advanced-oo-techniques
#| echo: true

# Advanced Object-Oriented Techniques
# Create a comprehensive comparison visualization

# Prepare data for comparison
comparison_data = pd.merge(
    avgDF_2010[['home', 'totalRuns']].rename(columns={'totalRuns': 'runs_2010'}),
    avgDF_2021[['home', 'totalRuns']].rename(columns={'totalRuns': 'runs_2021'}),
    on='home', how='inner'
)

**Question 2: Explanation of the Visualization**
- Ask AI To Add A Paragraph Here To Explain The Visualization

**Answer**

**Summary of the Visualization:** 

- Colorado's dominant run-friendliness is revealed across 2010 and 2021 seasons
- Coors Field consistently leads all MLB stadiums in average runs per game, which confirms the altitude advantage makes it the most hitter-friendly ballpark in baseball
- Visualization ranks every stadium by total runs, showing the entire league's spectrum, which extends from highest-scoring environments (Colorado) to most pitcher-friendly parks
- By tracking both years, we can identify which teams‚Äô home parks rank closest to Colorado (high-run environments) versus those furthest away (low-run, pitcher-friendly parks).
- The gap between Colorado and league average reveals the magnitude of Coors Field‚Äôs scoring advantage, while the overall distribution shows how teams are distributed across the scoring spectrum
- This comparison across 2010 vs 2021 helps reveal era effects, rule changes, and competitive balance shifts that impact league-wide run rates over time.

**Comparable stadiums:**

- **Camden Yards (Orioles):** 
  - Known as one of baseball's most influential modern ballparks
  - Typically ranks near the middle of the run-friendliness spectrum
  - Dimensions and design create relatively neutral environment for scoring
  - Interesting benchmark to evaluate whether Colorado is truly exceptional vs. simply above-average

- **Fenway Park (Red Sox):** 
  - One of baseball's most iconic venues
  - Unusual dimensions and Green Monster create unique scoring profile
  - Located near bottom of run-friendliness rankings (pitcher-friendly park)
  - Provides sharp contrast to Colorado's high-run environment
  - Illustrates dramatic range of scoring environments across MLB stadiums

- Does AI come to the right conclusion?  If not, why not?

**Answer**

AI (I used chatGPT) came up with a technical explaination (around constructs used in the Python code). It also did not come to the right conclusion to begin with. The prompt had to be rephrased to get a reasonable answer as it was not understanding the dataset and visualization properly.
